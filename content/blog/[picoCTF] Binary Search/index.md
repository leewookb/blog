### Binary Search

#### Description

Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!

```
Welcome to the Binary Search Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.
Enter your guess: 500
Lower! Try again.
Enter your guess: 250
Higher! Try again.
Enter your guess: 375
Lower! Try again.
Enter your guess: 313
Lower! Try again.
Enter your guess: 282
Higher! Try again.
Enter your guess: 297
Lower! Try again.
Enter your guess: 289
Higher! Try again.
Enter your guess: 293
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: 293
Here's your flag: picoCTF{g00d_gu355_2e90d29b}

This one was fairly easy because I was already familiar with the Binary Search Algorithm.
Majoring in Computer Science finally paid off.. ðŸ˜­
