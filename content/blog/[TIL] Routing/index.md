> I'm currently studying for the CCNA exam, primarily using Jeremy's IT Lab YouTube channel. He's well-known for providing great CCNA content, and the best part is that it's all free on YouTube. Jeremy also offers Anki flashcards, which I absolutely love and use daily, as well as Cisco Packet Tracer, which is an excellent resource for hands-on practice. I plan to take the exam in 3 to 4 months, though this timeline might change depending on my study and preparation progress.

Today, I learned about routing.
